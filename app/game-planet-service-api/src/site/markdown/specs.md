## The Game

Our associates are passionate about Star Wars and with that, we want to create a game with some information 
from the franchise.

To enable the front team to create this application, we want to develop an API that contains the data from the planets.

## Requirements

- The API must be REST
- For each planet, the following data must be obtained from the application's database, being manually entered:
    - Name
    - Climate
    - Ground
- For each planet we must also have the number of appearances in films, which can be obtained through the public Star Wars API: https://swapi.dev/about

## Desired features

- Add a planet (with name, climate and terrain)
- List planets
- Search by name
- Search by ID
- Remove planet

## Languages (choose)

- Java
- Go

## Databases (choose)

- MongoDB
- Cassandra
- DynamoDB
- Datomic
